# Daily Notes - 2026-02-28

## Session Diagnostic Run - 02:20 UTC

### Issue Reported
User reported stale/broken sessions and inability to communicate with platform and agents.

### Root Causes Found

#### CRITICAL: new_task tool not supported in orchestrator mode
- Session `4009d8af-757c-4817-a7a4-21ea4020bb87` (orchestrator) attempted to spawn a debug subagent via `new_task` tool
- CLI logged: `ERROR: Unhandled tool: new_task`
- This aborted the orchestrator task entirely, causing the "broken session" symptom
- The orchestrator spawned this debug session (`019ca20b`) as a workaround via a different mechanism

#### CRITICAL: Session version mismatch on restore
- Session `4009d8af` was created at schema version 2, but CLI expects version 3
- On restore, all blob URLs were null: no conversation history, no UI messages, no task metadata
- CLI created empty files and started fresh, losing all prior context
- Log: `SessionLifecycleService WARN: Session version mismatch {"expectedVersion":3,"actualVersion":2}`

#### NOT INSTALLED: OpenClaw platform
- `openclaw` CLI: not installed
- Gateway port 18789: not listening
- `~/.openclaw/` directory: does not exist
- This workspace contains OpenClaw configuration files but the platform itself is not set up
- All TOOLS.md references to openclaw commands will fail

#### NOT CONFIGURED: Telegram messaging
- All Group IDs and Thread IDs in TOOLS.md are placeholder values
- No Telegram bot token configured
- Messaging/notification system is completely non-functional

#### MISSING: Required directories
- `memory/` directory: did not exist (FIXED - created)
- `skills/` directory: does not exist
- `memory/heartbeat-state.json`: did not exist (FIXED - created with default state)

#### MINOR: Lock contention on model cache
- Multiple concurrent agent processes caused ELOCKED on openrouter_models.json
- 3 agent sessions running simultaneously in this workspace
- Self-resolving, not a persistent issue

### Fixes Applied
1. Created `memory/` directory
2. Created `memory/heartbeat-state.json` with default state
3. Created this daily note

### Cannot Fix (Platform-Level Issues)
1. Session version mismatch: requires platform update to schema v3 compatibility
2. `new_task` tool not supported: requires CLI update or mode configuration change
3. OpenClaw not installed: requires `npm install -g openclaw` and full setup per README
4. Telegram not configured: requires Telegram group creation and TOOLS.md update
5. `BOOTSTRAP.md` still present: should be deleted after first-run ritual

### Recommendations
- Do not use `new_task` tool in orchestrator mode until CLI supports it
- Start fresh sessions rather than resuming version-mismatched ones
- Complete OpenClaw setup per README.md if platform features are needed
- Configure Telegram per prompts/11-messaging-setup.md
