# Prompt 9: Health Tracking

**What this builds:** Food and symptom tracking journal with reminders and trend analysis.

```
Build a food and symptom tracking journal:

1. Entry types:
   - food: what you ate, portion size, time
   - drink: beverages, caffeine, alcohol
   - symptom: what you felt, severity (1-5 scale), time
   - note: free-form observations

2. Reminders (3x daily):
   - 8am: morning check-in
   - 1pm: lunch log
   - 7pm: evening summary
   - Reminders go to a dedicated health Telegram topic

3. Storage:
   - Markdown files organized by date (memory/health/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
   - Structured JSON for analysis (food-log.json)
   - Privacy: health data is Confidential tier (DM-only)

4. Analysis (weekly):
   - Correlate foods with symptoms
   - Identify potential triggers
   - Track trends over time (energy levels, sleep quality, etc.)
   - Deliver weekly summary to health channel

5. Natural language interface:
   - "Log lunch: salad and water"
   - "I have a headache, severity 3"
   - "What did I eat yesterday?"
   - "Show my symptom patterns this week"
```
