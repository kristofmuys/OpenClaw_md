# Prompt 10: Daily Briefing

**What this builds:** Comprehensive 7am daily briefing with calendar context, performance data, and action items.

```
Build a 7am daily briefing:

1. Calendar section:
   - Today's meetings with full CRM context on every attendee
   - Not just "meeting with Greg at 2pm" but who Greg is, company, last interaction
   - Flag double-bookings or back-to-back meetings with no buffer
   - Optional: background research on important meeting participants

2. Content performance (yesterday):
   - YouTube: views, watch time, top performing video
   - Instagram: engagement, follower change
   - X/Twitter: impressions, top post
   - Outliers: anything that performed unusually well or poorly

3. Action items:
   - Pending action items from meetings
   - What's overdue
   - What you're waiting on from other people
   - Due today or this week

4. Email highlights:
   - Urgent emails that need attention today
   - Cross-reference email threads related to today's meetings

5. Delivery rules:
   - Single consolidated message (not multiple messages)
   - Keep urgent emails, CRM notifications, and follow-ups in their own topics
   - Nothing gets duplicated across topics
   - If briefing fails, alert immediately
```
